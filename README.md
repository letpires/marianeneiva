Hey there ðŸ‘‹,

I graduated in Computer Science at University of Mato Grosso do Sul in 2014 and have been researching since then. I finished my Master Degree in Computer Vision which I researching several preprocessing methods such as anisotropic and isotropic diffusions to improve **Texture Classification**.  
Nowadays, I have been working as an **Data Science reasearcher** at University of Sao Paulo where I am finishing my Phd Studies at ICMC and also applying the analytical methodologies to create knowledge over Rare Diseases in Brazil.

Furthermore, one of my passions is information around science, technology, data science, among others. I am a content creator at <a href="https://instagram.com/maribneiva/">Instagram</a> and my curiosity from early earliers in Photoshop and design also gave me the opportunity to now create filters for instagram using ***Spark AR*** that could be acessed on my profile.

Due to the 2020 pandemic, I joined a volunteer group and we daily update data of COVID-19 in Brazil and predictions using epidemiologic models at: <a href="https://ciis.fmrp.usp.br/covid19/">Portal COVID-19 Brasil</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
